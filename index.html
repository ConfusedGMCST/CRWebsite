        <p>In the United States, consumers rights are often infringed upon by large companies, especially in the case of ownership. The closest consumerâ€™s right case to ownership was the 2013 Supreme Court case Kirtsaeng v. Wiley which set a precedent that the purchase of goods makes the consumer the owner and they have the rights to do what they want with said product as in sell, lend, giveaway that copy of a product. (6-3 majority opinion for Kirtsaeng). However, there is no law or case regarding ownership of goods in the United States. </p>

            In the United Kingdom, the Consumer Rights Act of 2015 protects the rights of ownership for British citizens, unlike the US.

            "Part 1: Chapter 2: Section 4 of the Consumers Rights Act 2015
            
            Section 16: goods must be ascertained,
            Section 17: property passes when intended to pass,
            Section 18: rules for ascertaining intention,
            Section 19: reservation of right of disposal,
            Section 20A: undivided shares in goods forming part of a bulk,
            Section 20B: deemed consent by co-owner to dealings in bulk goods"
