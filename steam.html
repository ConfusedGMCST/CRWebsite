                Steam does not let consumers resell their games online
                This violates the Kirtsaeng v. Wiley precedent that allows consumers to sell their copy of a product.

                Steam takes 30% of the money you pay on each purchase.

        <p class="ferrariP4">
            On August 9th, 2024, Steam had allegedly violated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, receiving a lawsuit for doing so.
            The case claims that Steam is monopolizing by utilizing pricing restraints against other game companies
            Steam has allegedly been violating the Sherman Act by using tying as a business move (Forcing buyers to purchase another product for the desired product is considered tying)
            On August 12th, Steam had been stopping video game designers from discounting their prices on other apps so people would go to steam
