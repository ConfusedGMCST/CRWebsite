                Apple doesn’t allow third party payments on their applications as without it, the company doesn’t get a cut of money off purchases. Apple is only worried of losing money on its devices from third party sources like game websites, other companies, etc.

            <p class="appleP1">
                Only apps specifically designed for Apple’s app store can be downloaded so that Apple has control over all apps in the store. Apple only puts games on the app store that they can gain money from.

            Apple devices only or most of the time are compatible with just other Apple devices
            Apple watches are only compatible with iPhones unlike other brands of smart watches compatible with iPhone as well
            Android users texts are shown up as green bubbles and Apple deliberately lowers the quality of video over text for the Android user, as well as leaving their messages as unencrypted to make consumers perceive Androids as inferior
